# CodeKeeper - The Hero

## Lore
> A skilled programmer has to swiftly navigate through maze of code, fearlessly fight encountered errors and bravely reach the imposed deadline by smartly using all available resources.
And now is the time to show your fellow coworkers that you are a better programmer than them. Not a particularly noble cause, but... ready, steady, code!


## The Goal
The goal of the game is to make the hero reach the exit of the maze alive. This may require fighting monsters and gathering necessary supplies, but also there may be some treasures along the way.

## Rules
> (You can access the game's source code on https://github.com/acatai/CodeKeeper-TheHero.)
Maze

A rectangle of cells of width 16 and height 12, where 0 0 is the top left corner and 15 11 is the bottom right corner.
Each cell can be passable or an obstacle. No entity can occupy or step into an obstacle.
Moving through the game is only possible by making steps in cardinal directions (left, right, up, down). Seeing or attacking in range n applies to all cells reachable from the entity position by making n steps in any (cardinal or diagonal) direction.

### Hero
Only player-controlled entity. He has known x, y position and health points. Health points cannot go above 20. When they reach 0 or below, the game ends, and the score is reduced by 1000. Ending the game with an error (timeout, wrong command, etc.) sets the final score to -10000.
The hero can only see a portion of the maze around him, having perfect knowledge about all entities in range 3. (The visualization of fog can be turned on/off in the viewer settings.)
During a turn, the hero can either move to an adjacent cell or attack a terget cell with one of his weapons. Hero actions are performed at the beginning of the turn, before the monsters reaction.

### Weapons
There are four weapons the hero can use: sword, hammer, scythe, and bow. There are no limitations on using sword, but the remaining ones require to spend a charge. Each weapon has a separate charge counter, which is initialized to 5 at the beginning of every game.
To use a weapon, a target cell within the valid range has to be specified. If a given cell is outside the weapon's range, no action is performed and the charge is not spent.

#### Sword
Sword: 10 damage
Applies damage to one cell that is a step away (in cardinal direction) from the hero.

#### Hammer
Hammer: 6 damage
Applies damage to three cells in range 1. If the given target is diagonal, the attack also hits the closest neighbours in the two adjacent cardinal directions from the hero. If the target is in a cardinal direction, it also hits the closest neighbouring cells in the two diagonal adjacent directions.

#### Scythe
Scythe: 7 damage
A target can be any cell in the chess queen move pattern limited to distance 2. The attack applies damage to the two cells covered by a queen move pattern containing the given target cell.

#### Bow
Bow: 8 damage
Applies damage to any single cell visible by the hero (which is in range â‰¤ 3).

### Monsters
Each type of monster has associated initial health, view range, attack range, and damage. If a monster health hits 0, it is destroyed and the hero score is increased by the amount of the monster's initial health.
During a turn, monster actions are performed after the heroes' and the order in which they are acting is uniformly random in each turn.
If the hero is within the monster's attack range, the monster attacks reducing hero's health and score by damage. If the hero is within the monster's view range but not attack range, the monster is making a step towards hero (possibly avoiding obstacles along the way). Otherwise, the monster stays in place and makes no action.
At most one monster can occupy a cell at any moment. During the movement, each monster considers the other ones as unmoving obstacles.

> There are the following five types of monsters:

Box: 1 health, 0 view range, 0 attack range, 0 damage.
Skeleton: 6 health, 1 view range, 1 attack range, 1 damage.
Gargoyle: 14 health, 2 view range, 1 attack range, 2 damage.
Orc: 8 health, 2 view range, 2 attack range, 2 damage.
Vampire: 10 health, 3 view range, 1 attack range, 3 damage.

### Items
An item can be found only at passable cells, and there is at most one item on a single cell. A monster can stay on top of an item, but it is not influencing it in any way.
If the hero moves into a cell containing an item, its effect is immediately applied.

> The following item types may be found in the maze:

Exit: Ends the level with success and increases the score by 10000.
Treasure: Increases the score by 100.
Potion: Gives up to 10 health (never exceeds the hero's maximum health).
Hammer: A chest giving additional hammer charge.
Scythe: A chest giving additional scythe charge.
Bow: A chest giving additional bow charge.
